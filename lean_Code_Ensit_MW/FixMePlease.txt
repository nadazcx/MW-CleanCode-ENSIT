//Q3: What we should call our function that return User?

//Q4: We want to check if that our student yearly grade is acceptable for any country Education System (in Tunisia <20, in USA 100)
isGradeBelowMax(maxGrade, 20)

//Q5: I know you got the idea of variable names but I want it to be clear for anyone around the world.

//Q6: Don't you think we are overdoing it??? ( ys i think)
Type Student {

//Q7: What we can do to avoid giving unappropriat gender value? (Hint enum)
Enum gender {
    "Male",
    "Female"
}

//Q8: Is it good idea to display all these arguments in one line like this? no 
we can use  a class student
displayUserDetails(firstName: String, lastName: String, id: Number, department: String, university: String){
// Some logic happens here

//Q9: Is it good idea to give all these arguments to one function?  No we can use  a class student
